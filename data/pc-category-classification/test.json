    "narrative": "I have a pen that I haven't used yet - it's still in the original packaging and has been kept in my refrigerator since I got it two weeks ago. Was looking at it today to prepare for starting it this week and noticed something concerning when I examined the solution. At the very bottom of the cartridge, there's this thick white sediment that's accumulated down there. It's definitely not normal - it looks almost pasty or gel-like, not like the clear liquid solution. I tried gently rolling the pen between my palms like the instructions say to do if you see particles, thinking maybe it would mix back in and dissolve. But even after rolling it for several minutes, the sediment stays clumped at the bottom. It doesn't redissolve or disperse back into the solution. The rest of the solution in the upper portion of the cartridge looks perfectly normal and clear, but this sediment at the bottom is just sitting there. The pen has been properly refrigerated the whole time - I keep my fridge temp between 36 and 40 degrees like you're supposed to. This isn't from improper storage on my end. It looks like the protein in the solution has separated out or aggregated or something. That's a sign of degradation, right? Obviously not using this pen. The pharmacy agreed this is abnormal appearance and they're replacing it. They said the manufacturer will want to test it to see what caused the sedimentation.",

Didn't realize my mistake until this morning when I went to check on it and found it sitting in the freezer section. It had been in there for probably 24 hours. The solution was actually partially frozen - I could see it wasn't fully solid but definitely had ice in it. I took it out and let it thaw at room temperature for a few hours, and now the solution looks clear again, no crystals or anything visible. Called the pharmacist to ask if it's still safe to use and she said absolutely not, that freezing the medication destroys it and I need to throw it away and get a new one. Something about the protein structure being damaged by freezing even if it looks normal after thawing. So now I'm out a pen because of my own carelessness. Just want to document what happened in case anyone else makes the same mistake - don't use it after freezing even if it looks okay.",

The green cap has a visible crack running down the side of it and doesn't stay on securely anymore. I'm really concerned about whether the internal mechanism might be damaged too, or if the cartridge seal is compromised. This is an injectable medication so integrity is really important. There's no way I'm using this pen when it's been subjected to that kind of physical trauma. I called the mail order pharmacy right away and they're sending a replacement overnight, but they said I need to send back the damaged one with photos for their quality records.

And the font used for the printing on the pen looks different too, like maybe a different typeface or size. Then I looked at the lot code on the carton and that font also seems inconsistent with what I'm used to seeing. The numbers look lighter or thinner somehow. Being suspicious at this point, I tried scanning the QR code with my phone to verify authenticity on the manufacturer's website like they tell you to do, and it's giving me an error message. Either the code isn't valid or it's not linking to the Novo Nordisk site like it should. I still have an empty pen from my last prescription and I compared them side by side - definitely differences in appearance. Called the pharmacy right away and they pulled my last prescription's info to compare lot numbers and packaging.

I let the pen sit upright in the fridge overnight thinking maybe the bubbles would rise to the top and dissipate, you know, like sometimes happens when you first open something. But this morning when I checked it again, the cloudiness is still there and the bubbles haven't gone away at all. All my previous pens from other lots have been perfectly clear and colorless. This one just looks different. The solution might still be okay, but the instructions say it should be clear and the visual appearance is supposed to be checked before each use. Since this one doesn't match what I'm used to seeing and doesn't match the description in the instructions, I don't feel comfortable using it.

The tracking showed it was out for delivery yesterday morning and marked as delivered at 10 AM. But I never received it. Turns out the courier mis-delivered it to my neighbor's house two doors down instead of mine. My neighbor has an enclosed front porch that isn't visible from the street, so they didn't notice the package sitting there until this morning when they were leaving for work. They brought it over to me, which was nice of them, but by then it had been sitting on their enclosed porch for almost two full days. When I felt the package, it was room temperature or even warmer - remember, it's been sitting in an enclosed porch for 48 hours. Opened it up and the ice packs were completely thawed, just bags of warm water at this point. Based on the timeline, this medication has been unrefrigerated in a warm environment for approximately 48 hours. The storage requirements say it needs to be refrigerated and shouldn't be exposed to temperatures above 86 degrees for extended periods. I have no idea what temperature it reached sitting in that enclosed porch, but it's definitely been compromised. Called the specialty pharmacy and they're sending a replacement at no charge, but this is a waste of medication due to a delivery error.

This pen has never been opened or used - it's brand new, still sealed in the original packaging. The presence of any kind of particulate matter in a sterile injectable medication is totally unacceptable. This is supposed to be a sterile product and there should be nothing floating in it. I took the pen directly to the pharmacy to show them. The pharmacist looked at it under their magnifying light and agreed it's definitely a foreign particle of some kind. She immediately documented everything, took pictures, recorded the lot number, and replaced the pen with one from a different batch. She said they'll be sending this one back to the manufacturer and filing a contamination report.

But when I look at the actual pen dose selector dial, the markings only show 0.5 mg and 1 mg dose options. There's no 0.25 mg marking anywhere on the dial that I can see. This is a major problem because my prescription specifically requires that I start at the lower 0.25 mg dose for the first four weeks as a titration period before increasing. If the pen doesn't have 0.25 mg markings, how am I supposed to take that dose? Did they package the wrong pen in this carton? Is the carton labeling wrong? I have no idea but the carton description and the actual device don't match up. I went back to the pharmacy to confirm I wasn't missing something, and the pharmacist looked at it and agreed there's definitely a mismatch - the carton says one thing and the pen shows another. She checked other pens in stock and they all had the correct dose markings that matched their cartons. So mine is some kind of labeling error or packaging mix-up.
