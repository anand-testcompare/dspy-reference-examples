But about a month ago, I started noticing that my hair was falling out. Like, a lot. I'm losing handfuls of hair in the shower,  -  it's coming out when I brush it, it's everywhere. I went to my doctor and she said it's telogen effluvium, which is hair loss that can happen after stress or major changes to your body. She thinks it's related to the um rapid weight like loss from the Ozempic. So it's not directly from the medication itself, but from the weight loss the medication causes. I'm really upset because I'm losing my hair, and it's affecting my self-esteem. I don't know if I should stop the medication, but my blood sugar is so much better. This is really affecting my quality of life. I think this needs to be documented because even though it's indirect, it's a significant problem.",

This is a major problem because my prescription specifically requires that I start at the lower 0.25 mg dose for the first four weeks as a titration period before increasing. If the pen doesn't have 0.25 mg markings, how am I supposed to take that dose? Did they package the wrong pen in this carton? Is the carton labeling wrong?

I went back to the pharmacy to confirm I wasn't missing something, and the pharmacist looked at it and agreed there's definitely a mismatch - the carton says one thing and the pen shows another.

My neighbor has an enclosed front porch that isn't visible from the street, so they didn't notice the package sitting there until this morning when they were leaving for work. They brought it over to me, which was nice of them, but by then it had been sitting on their enclosed porch for almost two full days. When I felt the package, it was room temperature or even warmer - remember, it's been sitting in an enclosed porch for 48 hours. Opened it up and the ice packs were completely thawed, just bags of warm water at this point. Based on the timeline, this medication has been unrefrigerated in a warm environment for approximately 48 hours. The storage requirements say it needs to be refrigerated and shouldn't be exposed to temperatures above 86 degrees for extended periods. I have no idea what temperature it reached sitting in that enclosed porch, but it's definitely been compromised.
