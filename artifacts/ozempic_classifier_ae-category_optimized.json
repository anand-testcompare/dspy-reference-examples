        "complaint": "I've been on Ozempic for about 6 months now and overall it's been helping with my diabetes and I've lost a good amount of weight. But I started having pain after meals, especially dinner which tends to be my biggest meal. The pain is in my upper right abdomen, kind of under my rib cage. It's a sharp, cramping pain that gets worse if I eat anything fatty or greasy. Lasts for a couple hours after eating. This has been happening for maybe 6 weeks but it's been getting worse. Finally went to my doctor about it last week and she ordered an ultrasound of my abdomen. The ultrasound showed multiple gallstones and also my gallbladder wall is thickened. The doctor explained that rapid weight loss - I've lost about 42 pounds since starting the medication - increases the risk of forming gallstones. She referred me to a general surgeon who said I need to have my gallbladder removed. Surgery is scheduled for next month. They want me to stop the Ozempic and follow a low-fat diet until the surgery.",
        "reasoning": "The patient describes upper right abdominal pain, gallstones, and gallbladder wall thickening; rapid weight loss from Ozempic is a known risk factor for cholelithiasis and cholecystitis; these findings pertain to biliary pathology.",
        "classification": "Hepatobiliary (gallbladder) disease",
        "justification": "The complaint details gallstone formation and gallbladder thickening associated with rapid weight loss induced by Ozempic, which aligns with gallbladder disease."

        "complaint": "Okay so this is kind of embarrassing but I've been really constipated. Like, I moved up to the 1 mg dose and within a few days I just couldn't go. It's been over a week now and I'm so bloated and uncomfortable. I've tried drinking more water, eating prunes, all the things my mom always suggested, but nothing was working. Finally had to buy some laxatives from the pharmacy and that helped a bit, but I'm still not back to normal. My stomach feels so distended and I look like I'm pregnant or something. This never happened on the lower dose.",
        "reasoning": "The patient describes new\u2010onset constipation, abdominal bloating, and a feeling of distension after increasing the Ozempic dose, which are typical gastrointestinal side effects of GLP\u20111 receptor agonists and indicate delayed gut motility.",
        "classification": "Gastrointestinal disorders",
