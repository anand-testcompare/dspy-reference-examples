        "reasoning": "The complaint describes a localized skin reaction occurring at the semaglutide injection site, characterized by redness, itching, spreading erythema, burning sensation, and persistence for several days. These features are typical of an injection\u2011site reaction rather than a systemic hypersensitivity event.",
        "classification": "Injection-site reactions",

I've had some episodes where my vision goes dark for a few minutes. He attributes the rapid progression to the sudden drop in my A1C levels since starting Ozempic.
